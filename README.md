# Weather Prediction in Australia using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project was developed as the final project for a **Machine Learning with Python** course.  
The objective is to explore, preprocess, and model historical Australian weather data in order to predict weather-related outcomes using supervised machine learning techniques.

The project demonstrates the end-to-end machine learning workflow, including data analysis, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and comparison.

## Dataset 
The dataset contains historical weather observations from multiple locations in Australia, including features such as:
- Temperature
- Rainfall
- Humidity
- Wind speed and direction
- Atmospheric pressure

The data is cleaned and prepared to handle missing values, categorical variables, and feature scaling where required.

## Methodology
The project follows these main steps:
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Understanding data distributions and relationships  
   - Identifying missing values and outliers  

2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Handling missing data  
   - Encoding categorical variables  
   - Feature selection and scaling  

3. **Modeling**  
   - Training multiple machine learning models  
   - Comparing performance using appropriate evaluation metrics  

4. **Evaluation**  
   - Assessing model accuracy and generalization  
   - Interpreting results and identifying limitations  

## Technologies Used
- Python  
- NumPy  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  
- Jupyter Notebook  

## Results
The trained models were evaluated and compared to identify the most effective approach for this dataset.  
Performance metrics such as accuracy and other relevant scores were used to measure effectiveness.

## Key Learnings
- Applying the full machine learning pipeline in practice  
- Working with real-world, imperfect datasets  
- Understanding the impact of preprocessing and feature engineering on model performance
